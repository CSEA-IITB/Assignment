# Convener's/Volunteer's Assignment
This is an assignment for the application of convener or a volunteer in [Cybersecurity Club IITB](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csec.iitb).  
This assignment consists of 3 challenges. You don't need to complete all of them, just do as much as you can, but remember, you need to make detailed writeups on the challenges even if you were not able to complete them. We don't seek answers, we seek methods full of creativity and a fearless desire to learn more.  

The goal in all the challenges is to recover a hidden string(a `flag`). Have fun with the challenges! And in case you're stuck somewhere,
pls ping OofNoicety#1900 on discord, or use the contact details mentioned in the corresponding email.

You can have a look at some writeups for old CTFs [here](https://github.com/CSEA-IITB/WriteUps); in case you're wondering how to write a "writeup" - it needn't be formal, but must have your thought process jotted down

## How to submit?
Just make a **private** github repository for the writeups and code for solutions; add @jsahil730 as a colaborator and then fill this [form](https://forms.gle/uzQhXHhQnEopCeqAA)

## Deadline
The deadline for the assignment is 2nd July 2021 23:59 IST.  
Selected candidates would be contacted by us on the provided email-ids and would be interviewed on 3rd July onwards.

## Task 1
This may or may not be your first time on Github. However, we still want to teach you the nuances of the
simple things we use. And therefore, this task is nothing but a tutorial! (Free flag yay!)

Begin [here!](https://github.com/jsahil730/Assignment/tree/develop/folder)

You just need to report the individual pieces you found!

## Task 2
We were given some [Julia](https://julialang.org/) [code](task2/challenge.jl); however it uses some nifty tricks!
Any clues what might be happening here?

## Task 3
I just received this [funny audio](task3/challenge1.mp3) but I suspect that there's something hidden in it.
Can you find out its' secret for me?

### Update 1
Since we were asked for it ðŸ˜› -  
**Hint** : How many kinds of different phrases does the audio clip have? Is that in any manner related to computers? And have you heard of ASCII?

### Update 2
Well, I received another [funny audio](task3/challenge.mp3) today and I suspect that this has the same secret hidden as the other audio.
Can you please help me figure out the secret? It may just be the key for me to become a Csec convener!!!
